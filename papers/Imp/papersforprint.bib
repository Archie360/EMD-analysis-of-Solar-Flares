	abstract = {Methods. QPPs are analysed in the Hα emission from the centre of the fan (inner ribbon R1), a circular ribbon (R2), a remote source (R3), and an elongated ribbon (R4) located between R2 and R3. The methods of correlation, Fourier, wavelet, and empirical mode decomposition are used. QPPs in Hα emission are compared with those in microwave and X-ray emission.
Results. We found multi-wavelength QPPs with periods around 150 s, 125 s, and 190 s. The 150-s period is seen to co-exist in Hα, hard X-rays, and microwave emissions, that allowed us to connect it with ﬂare kernels R1 and R2. These kernels spatially coincide with the site of the primary ﬂare energy release. The 125-s period is found in the Hα emission of the elongated ribbon R4 and the microwave emission at 5.7 GHz during the decay phase. The 190-s period is present in the emission during all ﬂare phases in the Hα emission of both the remote source R3 and the elongated ribbon R4, in soft X-rays, and microwaves at 4–8 GHz.
Conclusions. We connected the dominant 150-s QPPs with the slipping reconnection mechanism occurring in the fan. We suggested that the period of 125 s in the elongated ribbon can be caused by a kink oscillation of the outer spine connecting the primary reconnection site with the remote footpoint. The period of 190 s is associated with the 3-min sunspot oscillations.},

It allowed for the ﬁrst ever analysis of oscillatory processes in a stellar ﬂare simultaneously in thermal and nonthermal emissions, conventionally considered to come from the corona and chromosphere of the star, respectively. The observed QPPs have periods 1.5 ± 0.15 hr (SXR) and 3 ± 0.6 hr (WL), and correlate well with each other. The unique relationship between the observed parameters of QPPs in SXR and WL allowed us to link them with oscillations of the electric current in the ﬂare loop, which directly affect the dynamics of nonthermal electrons and indirectly (via ohmic heating) the thermal plasma. These ﬁndings could be considered in favor of the equivalent LCR contour model of a ﬂare loop, at least in the extreme conditions of a stellar superﬂare.},

	abstract = {Decayless kink oscillations of solar coronal loops are studied in terms of a low-dimensional model based on a randomly driven Rayleigh oscillator with coeﬃcients experiencing random ﬂuctuations. The model considers kink oscillations as natural modes of coronal loops, decaying by linear resonant absorption. The damping is counteracted by random motions of the loop footpoints and the interaction of the loop with external quasi-steady ﬂows with random ﬂuctuations. In other words, the model combines the self-oscillatory and randomly driven mechanisms for the decayless behaviour. The random signals are taken to be of the stationary red noise nature. In the noiseless case, the model has an asymptotically stationary oscillatory solution, i.e., a kink self-oscillation. It is established that the kink oscillation period is practically independent of noise. This ﬁnding justiﬁes the seismological estimations of the kink and Alfvén speeds and the magnetic ﬁeld in an oscillating loop by kink oscillations, based on the observed oscillation period. The oscillatory patterns are found to be almost harmonic. Noisy ﬂuctuations of external ﬂows modulate the amplitude of the almost monochromatic oscillatory pattern symmetrically, while random motions of the loop footpoints cause antisymmetric amplitude modulation. Such modulations are also consistent with the observed behaviour.},

The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and least-squares ﬁt by a damped sine function were applied to obtain the periods (P) and damping times (τ) of the QPPs. We found that (1) the periods and damping times of the stellar QPPs are 16.21±15.86 minutes and 27.21±28.73 minutes, while those of the solar QPPs are 0.90±0.56 and 1.53±1.10 minutes, respectively; (2) the ratios of the damping times to the periods (t P) observed in the stellar QPPs (1.69±0.56) are statistically identical to those of solar QPPs (1.74±0.77); and (3) the scalings of the QPP damping time with the period are well described by the power law in both solar and stellar cases. The power indices of the solar and stellar QPPs are 0.96±0.10 and 0.98  0.05, respectively. This scaling is consistent with the scalings found for standing slow magnetoacoustic and kink modes in solar coronal loops. Thus, we propose that the underlying mechanism responsible for the stellar QPPs is the natural magnetohydrodynamic oscillation in the ﬂaring or adjacent coronal loops, as in the case of solar ﬂares.},

We present the detection of two diﬀerent types of QPP signals in the thermal emission light curves of the X9.3 class solar ﬂare SOL2017-09-06T12:02, which is the most powerful ﬂare of Cycle 24. The period of the shorter-period QPP drifts from about 12 to 25 seconds during the ﬂare. The observed properties of this QPP are consistent with a sausage oscillation of a plasma loop in the ﬂaring active region. The period of the longer-period QPP is about 4 to 5 minutes. Its properties are compatible with standing slow magnetoacoustic oscillations, which are often detected in coronal loops. For both QPP signals, other mechanisms such as repetitive reconnection cannot be ruled out, however. The studied solar ﬂare has an energy in the realm of observed stellar ﬂares, and the fact that there is evidence of a short-period QPP signal typical of solar ﬂares along with a long-period QPP signal more typical of stellar ﬂares suggests that the diﬀerent ranges of QPP periods typically observed in solar and stellar ﬂares is likely due to observational constraints, and that similar physical processes may be occurring in solar and stellar ﬂares.},

The phase relationship of soft X-ray emissions in diﬀerent energy bands using cross-correlation technique show that these modes are standing in nature as we do not ﬁnd the phase lag.

            In this paper, we use the Si iv 1393.755 Å spectral line observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) in the quiet-Sun (QS) to determine the physical nature of the solar transition region (TR) oscillations. We analyse the properties of these oscillations using wavelet tools (e.g. power, cross-power, coherence, and phase difference) along with the stringent noise model (i.e. power law + constant). We estimate the period of the intensity and Doppler velocity oscillations at each chosen location in the QS and quantify the distribution of the statistically significant power and associated periods in one bright region and two dark regions. In the bright TR region, the mean periods in intensity and velocity are 7 min and 8 min, respectively. In the dark regions, the mean periods in intensity and velocity are 7 min and 5.4 min, respectively. We also estimate the phase difference between the intensity and Doppler velocity oscillations at each location. The statistical distribution of the phase difference is estimated, which peaks at −119° ± 13°, 33° ± 10°, 102° ± 10° in the bright region and at −153° ± 13°, 6° ± 20°, 151° ± 10° in the dark regions. The statistical distribution reveals that the oscillations are caused by propagating slow magneto-acoustic waves encountered with the TR. Some of these locations may also be associated with standing slow waves. Moreover, in the given time domain, several locations exhibit the presence of both propagating and standing oscillations at different frequencies.},

This paper presents an improved and robust automatic oscillation detection algorithm based on noise-assisted data analysis that can handle multiple oscillatory modes in the presence of both coloured and white noise along with non-stationary effects. The dyadic filter bank property of multivariate empirical mode decomposition has been used to accurately detect the oscillations and to calculate the associated characteristics.

Determining the prevalence of non-stationarity in QPPs contributes to a better understanding of which mechanism(s) is (are) responsible in QPP generation. We obtain the rate of period evolution from QPPs in 98 M- and X- class flares from Solar Cycle 24 with average periods between 8-130 s and investigate the prevalence of QPP non-stationarity. We also investigate whether the presence of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) impacts the period evolution of QPPs. We analyse soft X-ray lightcurves obtained from GOES’ X-Ray Sensor (XRS) and assess the dominant periods in the impulsive and decay phases of the flares using the Fast Fourier Transform. We relate the rate of period evolution to flare duration, peak flare energy, and average QPP period. We find evidence of non-stationarity in 81\% of the flares assessed, with most QPPs exhibiting a period evolution of ≤10 s between the impulsive and decay phases, of which 66\% exhibited an apparent period growth and 14\% showed an apparent period shrinkage. We find a positive correlation between the absolute magnitude of period evolution and the duration of the flare and no correlation between the period evolution of the QPPs and flare energy or CME presence.

	abstract = {We present the detection of an energetic ﬂare on the pre-main-sequence M3 star NGTS J121939.5–355557, which we estimate to be only 2 Myr old. The ﬂare had an energy of 3.2 ±00..43 ×1036 erg and a fractional amplitude of 7.2 ± 0.8, making it one of the most energetic ﬂares seen on an M star. The star is also X-ray active, in the saturated regime with log LX/LBol = −3.1. In the ﬂare’s peak, we have identiﬁed multimode quasi-periodic pulsations formed of two statistically signiﬁcant periods of approximately 320 and 660 s. This ﬂare is one of the largest amplitude events to exhibit such pulsations. The shorter period mode is observed to start after a short-lived spike in ﬂux lasting around 30 s, which would not have been resolved in Kepler or TESS short-cadence modes. Our data show how the high cadence of the Next Generation Transient Survey (NGTS) can be used to apply solar techniques to stellar ﬂares and to identify potential causes of the observed oscillations. We also discuss the implications of this ﬂare for the habitability of planets around M star hosts and how NGTS can help our understanding of this.},

We report the discovery of mHz QPOs in an XMM–Newton observation of the transient 1RXS J180408.9−342058, during a regular bursting phase of its 2015 outburst. We found signiﬁcant periodic signals in the March observation, with frequencies in the range 5–8 mHz, superimposed on a strong ∼1/f power-law noise continuum. Neither the QPO signals nor the power-law noise were present during the April observation, which exhibited a 2.5 × higher luminosity and had correspondingly more frequent bursts. When present, the QPO signal power decreases during bursts and disappears afterwards, similar to the behaviour in other sources. 1RXS J180408.9−342058 is the eighth source known to date that exhibits such QPOs driven by thermonuclear burning. We examine the range of properties of the QPO signals in different sources. Whereas the observed oscillation proﬁle is similar to that predicted by numerical models, the amplitudes are signiﬁcantly higher, challenging their explanation as originating from marginally stable burning.},

	abstract = {The detection of transiting exoplanets in time-series photometry requires the removal or modeling of instrumental and stellar noise. While instrumental systematics can be reduced using methods such as pixel level decorrelation, removing stellar trends while preserving transit signals proves challenging. As a result of vast archives of light curves from recent transit surveys, there is a strong need for accurate automatic detrending, without human intervention. A large variety of detrending algorithms are in active use, but their comparative performance for transit discovery is unexplored. We benchmark all commonly used detrending methods against hundreds of Kepler, K2, and TESS planets, selected to represent the most difﬁcult cases for systems with small planet-to-star radius ratios. The full parameter range is explored for each method to determine the best choices for planet discovery. We conclude that the ideal method is a timewindowed slider with an iterative robust location estimator based on Tukey’s biweight. This method recovers 99\% and 94\% of the shallowest Kepler and K2 planets, respectively. We include an additional analysis for young stars with extreme variability and conclude they are best treated using a spline-based method with a robust Huber estimator. All stellar detrending methods explored are available for public use in Wōtan, an open-source Python package on GitHub (https://github.com/hippke/wotan).},

	abstract = {Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) appear to be a common feature observed in the light curves of both solar and stellar ﬂares. However, their quasi-periodic nature, along with the fact that they can be small in amplitude and short-lived, makes QPPs difﬁcult to unequivocally detect. In this paper, we test the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art methods for detecting QPPs using a series of hare-and-hounds exercises. The hare simulated a set of ﬂares, both with and without QPPs of a variety of forms, while the hounds attempted to detect QPPs in blind tests. We use the results of these exercises to create a blueprint for anyone who wishes to detect QPPs in real solar and stellar data. We present eight clear recommendations to be kept in mind for future QPP detections, with the plethora of solar and stellar ﬂare data from new and future satellites. These recommendations address the key pitfalls in QPP detection, including detrending, trimming data, accounting for colored noise, detecting stationary-period QPPs, detecting QPPs with nonstationary periods, and ensuring that detections are robust and false detections are minimized. We ﬁnd that QPPs can be detected reliably and robustly by a variety of methods, which are clearly identiﬁed and described, if the appropriate care and due diligence are taken.},

Therefore, we perform a large-scale search for evidence of signals consistent with QPP in solar ﬂares, focusing on the 1–300 s timescale. We analyze 675 M- and X-class ﬂares observed by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series in 1–8 Å soft X-rays between 2011 February 1 and 2015 December 31. Additionally, over the same era we analyze Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) 15–25 keV X-ray data for each of these ﬂares associated with a Fermi/GBM solar ﬂare trigger, a total of 261 events. Using a model comparison method, we determine whether there is evidence for a substantial enhancement in the Fourier power spectrum that may be consistent with a QPP signature, based on three tested models; a power-law plus a constant, a broken power-law plus constant, and a power-law-plus-constant with an additional QPP signature component. From this, we determine that ∼30\% of GOES events and ∼8\% of Fermi/GBM events show strong signatures consistent with classical interpretations of QPP. For the remaining events either two or more tested models cannot be strongly distinguished from each other, or the events are welldescribed by single power-law or broken power-law Fourier power spectra. For both instruments, a preferred characteristic timescale of ∼5–30 s was found in the QPP-like events, with no dependence on ﬂare magnitude in either GOES or GBM data. We also show that individual events in the sample show similar characteristic timescales in both GBM and GOES data sets. We discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of solar ﬂares and possible QPP mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Ultralow frequency (ULF) waves are electromagnetic pulsations observed throughout the magnetosphere driven by processes both external and internal to the magnetosphere. Within the magnetosphere, discrete and broadband ULF wave activity can couple to the local plasma via coherent or stochastic wave-particle interactions. These wave-particle interactions can lead to dynamic changes in local plasma including rapid acceleration and transport of radiation belt electrons. Using observations from GOES-15 and the Automated Flare Inference of Oscillations algorithm we investigate the distribution and occurrence of broadband and discrete ULF waves to help understand the relative importance of coherent and stochastic wave-particle interactions. We find that intervals of discrete ULF waves are more commonly identified during slow and low-density solar wind and when Bz is near zero. Broadband waves are more commonly identified during periods of active solar wind, including periods of high solar wind speeds and large density perturbations, and large negative Bz. We also find that under all solar wind conditions the number of intervals of broadband ULF wave power exceeds that of discrete wave power; for example, ULF wave activity is more likely to be broadband. These results suggest that radial diffusion due to incoherent broadband waves is an important driver of wave-particle interactions, especially during active solar wind conditions. However, the presence of discrete waves during both active and quiet solar wind conditions suggests that these waves and the corresponding wave-particle interactions cannot be ignored, especially since discrete wave-particle interactions tend to be more efficient than radial diffusion.},

	abstract = {Small-amplitude quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) detected in soft X-ray emission are commonplace in many ﬂares. To date, the underpinning processes resulting in the QPPs are unknown. In this paper, we attempt to constrain the prevalence of stationary QPPs in the largest statistical study to date, including a study of the relationship of QPP periods to the properties of the ﬂaring active region, ﬂare ribbons, and coronal mass ejection (CME) afﬁliation. We build upon the work of Inglis et al. and use a model comparison test to search for signiﬁcant power in the Fourier spectra of lightcurves of the GOES 1–8Å channel. We analyze all X-, M- and C-class ﬂares of the past solar cycle, a total of 5519 ﬂares, and search for periodicity in the 6–300s timescale range. Approximately 46\% of X-class, 29\% of M-class, and 7\% of C-class ﬂares show evidence of stationary QPPs, with periods that follow a log-normal distribution peaked at 20s. The QPP periods were found to be independent of ﬂare magnitude; however, a positive correlation was found between QPP period and ﬂare duration. No dependence of the QPP periods on the global active region properties was identiﬁed. A positive correlation was found between QPPs and ribbon properties, including unsigned magnetic ﬂux, ribbon area, and ribbon separation distance. We found that both ﬂares with and without an associated CME can host QPPs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for X- and M-class ﬂares, decay-phase QPPs have statistically longer periods than impulsive-phase QPPs.},
